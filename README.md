# Simple-visualization-of-random-walk

This is a simple use of maplotlib library to visualize random walk. 
A random walk is simply a path that has no clear direction but is determined
by a series of random decisions, each of which is left entirely to chance. You
might imagine a random walk as the path a confused ant would take if it
took every step in a random direction.
